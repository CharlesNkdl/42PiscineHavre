# 42 School C Piscine

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises of the C Piscine at 42 School. The C Piscine is a 4-week intensive program that teaches the fundamentals of programming in the C language.

Each day of the C Piscine covers a specific topic, such as variables, loops, arrays, pointers, functions, and more. The exercises range from simple programs that print basic information to complex projects that require multiple files and functions.
